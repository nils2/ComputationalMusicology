The corpus will look at the evolution of Yellow Claw's through the years. To do this I made a chronological playlist of all their songs listed in their spotify page (except remixes). I have always liked yellow claw and still do. Thus wanted to compare their progress over the years to try and find if there are any differences. It is interessting as they are not the most famous Dutch DJ, but amongst peers they are known for having very nogstalgic songs.

Personally I expect they changed, this could be backed up by the fact that their first songs differ in quality from their first album (released in 2015). This is because their first album was released under the Mad Decent, which is Diplo's recordlabel. I suspect they learned a lot under Diplo's supervision, though I am unsure as to how they specifically changed. Maybe they added more BPM or changed timbres.

There might not be a big change at all. Since they have only been active for 10 years of which they spend only 8 producing their own songs.

"Thunder", "Shotgun", "Till It Hurts", "Amsterdamned", "In My Room" and "DJ Turn It Up" are very typical songs. These are very typical as they define their past and current style in beat and beatdrop. Whereas "Assets", "P*$$YRICH", "Wild Mustang", "Villain", "Another Life" and "Kiss Your Lips" are atypical songs. The last one is very strange as it is happy hardcore, a genre that does not befit Yellow Claw's style the same could be said for the other atypical songs.
